										<h1 style="text-align:center">My Journey</h1>
										<br>
										<h2>Past</h2>
										Growing up in a smalltown as a not-yet-diagnosed ASD/ADHD-er I struggled with the disconnect that seemed to exist between me and my peers. I found no interest in any of the sports, clubs, or cliques offered and I struggled to assimilate socially despite trying. I spent my time at home, basked in the glow of screens, writing poems and redesigning my Tumblr profile. <br> 
										Here, in this universe they called "The Web" I found a vast plane where I could explore the world around me and the people within it without limits. My insatiable curiosity finally had a field in which I felt safe enough to let it run wild and free, a place where the undying desire to learn was rewarded and not mocked.
										<br><br>
										<h2>Present</h2>
										As I got older I began to lose that wonder I first found in technology as a child. <br> 
										Like window-shopping I bounced around the vast field of Tech: a SysAdmin degree here, a cybersecurity certificate there, a dollop of helpdesk experience and a creeping anxiety about the end result of the zig-zagging path I found myself on. This fear was only compounded by my worsening chronic fatigue/illness and I was suddenly shaken awake by the prospect of ending up bed-ridden with no career due to my decreased physical abilities. <br>
										I decided it was time to re-design my path with my limitations, strengths, and dreams in mind.
										<br>
										I stumbled on 100Devs in January '22 via Twitter, where I had just created a brand new account with a curated feed of creators and entrepreneurs - free from local gossip, celebrity drama, and distractions. <br>
										From the very first stream I knew this man, this community, and this path was exactly what I had been searching for. The distinct remote-work possibilities made it possible for me to leverage my mind against the constraints of my fatigued body. The self-paced, neurodivergent-friendly coursework and instruction allowed me to learn in a way I never knew possible. Finally, Leon and the community gave me a much-needed sense of reunification with the world and the people in it: a soft-place to land when the troughs were deep and the boats were heavy. <br>
										Since starting my programming journey I am overjoyed to declare that I have rediscovered the love of tech I cultivated years ago, and i'm not giving it up this time. 
										<br><br>
										<h2>Future</h2>
										I no longer wonder who I am or where my path is leading. <br>
										I am a Software Engineer with a passion for utilizing my skills to create the vibrant, welcoming world I saw through childs eyes. <br>
										I will achieve my goals and dream bigger than I ever dared before. 
										<br><br>
										I am Chloe Wray, and I don't get got - I go get.
